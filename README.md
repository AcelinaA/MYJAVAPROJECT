# Summary of Java Programming Laboratory Activities & Final Project

This repository contains various Java programming activities that demonstrate fundamental and intermediate concepts including input handling, conditionals, GUI development (AWT & Swing), event-driven programming, and application design.

## Activities

### **LabActivity1EmployeeInformationSystem**
A simple console-based program that gathers an employee’s name, age, hours worked, and hourly wage. It computes and displays the daily salary using basic input handling and arithmetic operations.

---

### **LabActivity2EmployeeInformationSystemPart2**
An enhanced console application that extends the employee system with validations. It checks user age, working hours, and calculates salary from daily to annual levels including tax and government deductions.

---

### **LabActivity3ConditionalStatement**
A console application with conditional logic to assess employee eligibility based on age and working hours. It calculates salary breakdowns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and applies tax rules where applicable.

---

### **LabActivity4EmpInfoSystemGUI**
A GUI-based application using Java AWT that allows users to input employee data. It validates fields and displays the calculated daily salary within a formatted text area.

---

### **LabActivity5QuizAppAWT**
A Java AWT-based multiple-choice quiz application. It presents questions, allows answer selection, handles validation, and shows the user’s score upon completion.

---

### **LabActivity6SwingToDoList**
A simple to-do list application developed using Java Swing. It includes a task table viewer and a form to add new tasks with name, description, and status. It showcases multi-window interaction and table data management.

---

### **MyMidtermLabExam**
A basic IT ticketing system built for the console. Users can add tickets (with urgency levels), update their status, view existing tickets, and generate ticket reports. It demonstrates structured data storage using arrays.

---

### **LabCalcFinalProject**
A full-featured pink-themed calculator using Java Swing. Supports basic operations, advanced functions (%, √, x²), sign change, and a history log for previous calculations. It includes input validation and a responsive GUI layout.
